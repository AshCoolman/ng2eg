# Angular 2 examples

This project is my personal experiments with the new features, syntax and methodologies of angular 2.

This project was cloned and then stripped down from [https://github.com/davideast/ng2do](ng2do)


### Installation

```bash
npm install -g gulp # Not required if you already have gulp installed globally
npm install
gulp
gulp build # Currently this fails on my system so I need to run my own server
```


### How the installation works

The installation clones the [Angular 2 quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) which contains Angular and all of the dependencies to transpile from AtScript/TypeScript. The local .git folder for the quickstart is removed automatically.

### I want more Angular 2 info

Check out [the official Angular 2 website](https://angular.io).
